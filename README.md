# NatureConnect

### Rediscover Your Roots

## Introduction

Welcome to NatureConnect! A nature companion app designed to reconnect you with the world around us using APIs.

## Goals

- Sunrise and sunset times
- Moon phase
- Seasonal information, such as:
  - Wild plants in season
  - Best fruit and vegetables to by based on season and, potentially, locality
- Weather information, such as:
  - Local weather forecast
  - Historical forecast information, opening up the opportunity to show how climate change might be affecting your local area
